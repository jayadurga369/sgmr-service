There are two ways to run cypress tests, using the cypress test runner or running cypress tests using the command line.

By default tests run against local environment.

**NOTE:** You will need, the [sgmr-service](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/sgmr-service) along with [sgmr-data-api](https://gitlab.digital.homeoffice.gov.uk/cop/sgmr-data-api), and [ref-data-api](https://github.com/UKHomeOffice/ref-data-api) applications, to be running before triggering Cypress.

#### Running cypress test runner

Running all tests
```sh
npm run cypress:runner
```

Running all tests using environment settings from a configuration file
```sh
npm run cypress:runner -- --env configFile=dev
```
Once TestRunner launched, click on the interested spec inside folder cypress/integration/sGMR

#### Running cypress tests using the command line

Running all tests on local Environment, (It executes tests headless mode on Electron Browser)
```sh
npm run cypress:test:local
```

Running all tests on Development Environment, (It executes tests headless mode on Electron Browser)
```sh
npm run cypress:test:dev
```

Running a specific test
```sh
npm run cypress:test:local -- --spec cypress/integration/sGMR/register-user.spec.js
```

Running specific test with chrome browser
```sh
npm run cypress:test:local -- --browser chrome --spec cypress/integration/sGMR/user-register.spec.js
```

Running All E2E tests and generating mochawesome html report with screenshots
```sh
npm run cypress:test:report -- -b chrome
```

Running specific test and generating mochawesome html report with screenshots
```sh
npm run cypress:test:report -- -b chrome -s cypress/integration/sGMR/user-register.spec.js
```

## Changing the support email

If you would like to use a dummy email for testing purposes, change the following line in `config.js` from
```
export const supportEmail = process.env.GOV_NOTIFY_SUPPORT_EMAIL;
```
to:
```
export const supportEmail = 'youremail@emailprovider.com';
```
